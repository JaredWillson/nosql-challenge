# nosql-challenge
## Summary
This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks that are used to analyze food safety and restaurant reviews from the UK as published by the UK Food Standards Agency. The first notebook, NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb connects to a NoSQL database (using MongoDB) that is stored locally and contains documents from the establishments.json file also stored in this repository, in the Resources subdirectory. The notebook contains Python code that adds additional data to the database and manipulates existing data (typecasting). 

The second Jupyter notebook, NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb, extends the work started in the first notebook by analyzing the data by filtering, counting, grouping, aggregating, and printing specific documents.
